# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms in Jupyter notebooks.

## Algorithms

- **ANN.ipynb**: An implementation of a simple Artificial Neural Network.
- **CLUSTERING-kmeans.ipynb**: An implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm.
- **DECISION TREE.ipynb**: An implementation of a Decision Tree classifier.
- **LLINEAR REGRESSION.ipynb**: An implementation of Linear Regression.
- **MLE.ipynb**: An implementation of Maximum Likelihood Estimation.
- **NBC.ipynb**: An implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier for spam email detection.
- **OR GATE.ipynb**: A simple perceptron model to simulate the OR logic gate.
- **XOR.ipynb**: A simple perceptron model to simulate the XOR logic gate.

## Data

- **MLE data.xlsx**: Data used for the Maximum Likelihood Estimation notebook.

## How to Use

Each Jupyter notebook is self-contained and includes the necessary code and explanations for the implemented algorithm. You can open and run these notebooks in a Jupyter environment to see the algorithms in action.
